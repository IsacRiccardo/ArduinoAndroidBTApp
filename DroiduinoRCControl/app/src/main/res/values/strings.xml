    <string name="description_pid">Description "Get Supported PID\'s"\n\nThis command will notify you about the supported diagnostic parameter id\'s in your car. This translates into real time data like: engine load, speed, coolant temperatures etc…\n
    \nFunctionality:\n
    1. Press the button -> The supported PID\'s will be printed in hexadecimal form.\n
    2. Press and hold (After initial press) -> Important real time data will be printed.
